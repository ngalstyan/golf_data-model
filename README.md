# Golf Betting Model — Hierarchical Bayesian Strokes-Gained

A quantitative system for betting PGA Tour golf. It models player skill with a hierarchical Bayesian
strokes-gained framework, simulates tournaments via Monte Carlo, finds edges against sportsbook odds,
and sizes bets with fractional Kelly.

> **Status:** Head-to-head (H2H) matchup betting passes all validation gates and is the live strategy.
> Outright-winner betting does **not** pass calibration — see [Results](#results).

## Motivation

I love a lot of things, but also: golf and prediction markets. This project started as an attempt to put them together —
can a model actually beat the book on PGA Tour events?

My first instinct was the obvious one: **predict the outright winner.** It didn't work. A golf tournament
is ~150 players over 4 rounds with enormous variance — the winner is often a 30/1 to 80/1 longshot, and
there simply isn't enough signal to consistently identify them ahead of the market. Too little data, too
much noise. My model was systematically *overconfident* on longshots (its probability spread was ~1.9× the
market's), and the backtest profits, while positive, were concentrated in a handful of lucky events — not a
real, repeatable edge.

So I pivoted to **head-to-head matchup betting** ("will Player A beat Player B this week?"). This turned out
to be the right call:

- A matchup is a **2-outcome** market instead of a 150-outcome one — far less noise to fight.
- Sportsbook **vig is ~2–3%** on matchups vs. ~25% overround baked into outright markets.
- The model only has to rank two players relative to each other, which is exactly what strokes-gained data
  is good at.

On the matchup side the results held up across a proper expanding-window backtest, and that's what the
system bets today.

## Results

Validated on a strict **2023–2024 holdout** (expanding window, no lookahead), after training on 2017–2022.

### Head-to-head matchups — the live strategy

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Bets | 1,854 across 55 events |
| Win rate | 56.6% |
| ROI | +6.0% |
| Sharpe | 1.48 |
| Max drawdown | 27.9% |
| Backtest P&L | +$37,176 |
| Avg edge / odds / stake | 13.4% / 1.94 / $336 |

All H2H gates pass: sample ≥ 100, win rate > 50%, ROI > 0%, Sharpe > 0.3.

### Outright winners — shelved

Backtest ROI looked high (84%), but it **fails the gates that matter**:

- **Calibration:** model Brier 0.013 > market Brier 0.011 (worse than the book).
- **Significance:** Diebold-Mariano p ≈ 0.99; the model beat the market in only ~18% of events.
- **Concentration:** ~100% of the profit came from 3 events — luck, not edge.

The takeaway that drove the whole project: **a diversified stream of small matchup edges beats chasing
longshot winners.**

## How it works

Core generative model for golfer *i* in round *r* of tournament *t*:

```
Y_{i,r,t} = μ_{i,t} + γ_{c(t)} · δ_i + ε_{i,r,t}
```

- **μ_{i,t}** — player skill, estimated with Bayesian shrinkage over strokes-gained components
  (off-the-tee, approach, around-the-green, putting), time-weighted with dual EWMA decay (25 rounds / 120 days).
- **γ_{c(t)} · δ_i** — player × course-fit interaction (optional Phase 4).
- **ε ~ Student-t(ν=6)** — heavy-tailed round noise, because golf scoring has fat tails.

The pipeline then runs **50K–100K Monte Carlo tournament simulations** (cut rules, round correlation,
playoffs) to produce P(win), P(top-5/10), P(make-cut), and P(A beats B) for every player. Sportsbook odds are
de-vigged (Shin's method), compared to model probabilities to detect edges, and bets are sized with
**fractional (¼) Kelly** under exposure caps.

## What you need to run it (and why the data isn't here)

This repo is **code only**. To run it for real you need two paid/external pieces that I can't redistribute:

1. **DataGolf — Scratch PLUS subscription** ([datagolf.com](https://datagolf.com)). This is the source of
   round-level strokes-gained data, historical closing odds, and matchup odds. It's a **paid tier and the
   data is proprietary**, so none of the CSVs are committed here. You bring your own subscription and pull
   the data with the scripts in [`scripts/`](scripts/) (e.g. `scripts/14_pull_season_data.py`).
2. **Anthropic Claude API key** — only needed for the optional news-research briefing (see below). ~$0.30/week.

Free dependency: **Open-Meteo** for weather (no auth required). (if you develop thsi part of the project tho)

**Excluded from the repo** (see [`.gitignore`](.gitignore)): the `data/` directory (proprietary DataGolf
data), trained model `artifacts/`, research `cache/`, run logs, and all secrets. You regenerate data and
models locally.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Environment
conda env create -f golf_model/environment.yml
conda activate golf_model

# 2. Credentials
cp golf_model/.env.example golf_model/.env
#    Fill in GOLF_DATAGOLF_API_KEY and (optionally) ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# 3. Pull data (requires a DataGolf Scratch PLUS subscription)
python scripts/14_pull_season_data.py --key YOUR_DATAGOLF_API_KEY

# 4. Train / backtest / predict
python golf_model/run_pipeline.py --mode train
python golf_model/run_pipeline.py --mode backtest
python golf_model/run_pipeline.py --mode predict --event_id 12345
```

The weekly workflow lives in the notebooks — see
[`golf_model/notebooks/09_live_deployment.ipynb`](golf_model/notebooks/09_live_deployment.ipynb) and
[`golf_model/README.md`](golf_model/README.md) for the full operational routine.

## Roadmap / ways to improve

- **Weather integration.** Wind, rain, and temperature meaningfully shift scoring and favor certain player
  profiles. An Open-Meteo client is already scaffolded in
  [`golf_model/data/weather.py`](golf_model/data/weather.py); the next step is folding round-level weather
  into the noise/skill model so a bomber's edge in high wind (or a short-hitter's edge on a soft, calm track)
  is priced in.
- **Per-player course/track optimization.** This is the `γ_c · δ_i` course-fit term (Phase 4), currently
  optional because the course-feature dataset isn't populated. The goal: an 8-dimensional course vector
  (length, rough height, green speed, wind exposure, elevation, fairway width, green size, water) crossed
  with each player's strengths, so the model knows *this* player overperforms on *this kind* of track.
  Plan is Bayesian-ridge shrinkage with leave-one-course-out cross-validation.
- **News-intelligence agent.** A read-only pre-bet briefing
  ([`golf_model/research/news_agent.py`](golf_model/research/news_agent.py)) that scrapes recent Google News
  RSS for each player in a flagged matchup and uses the Claude API to summarize injury, form, equipment, and
  personal-life signals for human review before placing bets. It never modifies bets and is cached per
  player per week. Future extensions: Twitter/X integration (blocked for now by free-tier limits) and
  golf-podcast transcript analysis.
- **Outright model improvements.** Fix the overconfidence on longshots (probability tempering / better tail
  calibration) so the outright market can eventually clear the calibration gate.
- **Live odds + automated logging.** Tighter integration with sportsbook feeds and an automated P&L/CLV
  tracker.

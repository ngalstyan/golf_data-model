# TOURNAMENT STRUCTURE
# ---------------------
# Encodes the rules of a PGA Tour tournament:
#   - 4 rounds of 18 holes (72-hole stroke play)
#   - Cut after round 2 (typically top 65 and ties)
#   - Playoff for ties at the top (sudden death)
#   - Various field sizes and special rules
#
# This module converts raw simulated round scores into tournament outcomes
# (finish positions, made/missed cut, winner).
#
# Used by: simulation/monte_carlo.py
